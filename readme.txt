# Description

> DeekDbs (Database Syncer) is a database syncing / migration tool that can be used to copy or sync data across environments. The inspiration behind this project is to make the syncing, migration and backup of databases a bit easier when managing multiple clusters of databases.

# Primary Use Cases

- Syncing the databases or 2 more services across hosting providers.
- Backing up of database systems across hosting environments.
- Migrating data to a new web service.
