## Deek Database Syncer (DeekDBS) ##
DeekDbs is a database syncing / migration tool that can be used to copy or sync data across environments. The inspiration behind this problem is to make the syncing, migration and backup of data a bit easier. I have experience with writing database syncing tools for companies before. There are a wide variety of use cases.

## Common Use Cases ##
- Syncing the databases or 2 more services across hosting providers.
- Backing up of database systems across hosting environments.
- Migrating data to a new web service.
- Offsite / Cloud backups of data.
- Setting up Master/Slave databases.

A practical small use case for this could be where someone has 2 Wordpress websites and would like to sync posts made between the two websites.

DeekDBS can be used to quickly sync data across 1 or more than one environment across different database management systems. Currently the following are/will be supported.
- MySql / MySql migrations.
- MySql / MSSql migrations.
- MSSql / Mysql migrations.
- MSSql / MSSql migrations.

Additional database support can be added if required. I do private contracting work. :)

## Setup ##

DeekDBS can be set up on any operating system...

The are only a few simple requirements:
- Windows 10 installation... (A joke. ;)
- MySql 8+
- .Net Core 3.1 SDK/Runtime
- Node.js 8+
- NPM
